# Exposure Response Planning
Plan arrangement of exposure levels based on log scale and XX% effect

Easy way to visualize how exposure levels will arrange on a log scale.

Replace X values with possible dose values, change % effect size if needed (currently at 20% decline divided by number of exposure levels) and then plot as many as required.

Usually, linearity/consistent inter-level spacing is the goal.
